Feature: MooForge compatibility layer
  In order to be compliant with mooforge packages, we should accept
  various quirky source files.

  Scenario: Compiling a mooforge package that uses mooforge tag dependency notation
    When I run "jsus MooforgePlugin/Plugin tmp -d MooforgePlugin/Core"
    Then the following files should exist:
      | tmp/plugin.js |
    And file "tmp/plugin.js" should contain
      """
      /*
      ---

      script: Core.js
