  In order to leave unneccessary compatibility code out, I should be able to

  Scenario: compat12
    When I run "jsus Postprocessing/MootoolsCompat12 tmp --postproc moocompat12"
    Then the following files should exist:

    And file "tmp/package.js" should contain
      """
      /*
      ---

      script: Core.js
