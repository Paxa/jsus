Feature: external dependencies
  In order to resolve dependencies, jsus should be able to preload them into
  pool.
  
  Scenario: basic external dependency
    When I run "jsus -i ExternalDependency -o tmp -d ExternalDependency/Mootools"
    Then the following files should exist:
      | tmp/package.js |
    And file "tmp/package.js" should contain

      /*
