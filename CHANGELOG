= Jsus Changelog
== Version 0.3.2
Middleware changes:
* Fixed minor problem with middleware when package name and source file tag
  are the same
* Settings are now shared between Jsus::Middleware and subclasses
* Middleware now also supports /include/ directive (generates includes file),
  like -g option of CLI utility
* Hack for cache output paths to be recognizable by nginx

CLI changes:
* --very-verbose mode, outputs tree of your packages, very useful when debugging
  missing dependencies.
* If you have circular dependencies in your code, jsus will detect them and issue
  a huge warning message (WIP)

Shared changes:
* Pool instantiation will now follow symlinks one level deep
* Somewhat easier on eyes murdoc template

== Version 0.3.1
* Added wildcard support for Jsus::Middleware

== Version 0.3.0
* Added Jsus::Middleware for rack middleware stuff. Yay!

== Version 0.2.7
* Brushed up CLI code
* Added --watch option for cli (using fssm gem and fs backend for your operating system)
* Added --compress option for cli (using yui-compressor gem)

== Version 0.2.6
* Moved support classes to Jsus::Util module namespace
* Now using autoload instead of require's for stuff

== Version 0.2.5
* Fixed Container#sort not dealing with wildcards, which made it slower but
  at least made it work
* Reduced a whole ton of Container creation calls wherever they didn't seem
  appropriate
* Container sorting routine is now lazily evaluated

All in all, this resulted in 70% speedups on complex cases.

== Version 0.2.1
* Started adding cucumber features for command-line utility. Look into /features
  directory for reference
* Removed choice gem from list of dependency. Using stdlib's optparse instead

* Support for mooforge validator (checks if every file has authors && license),
  more validators at request

== Version 0.1.9
* Benchmarking results are now more verbose.

* Added extensions lookup to any call of SourceFile#content and SourceFile#required_files.

* Added caching to Jsus::Pool#lookup_direct_dependencies. This addresses some performance
  issues appeared in 0.1.6

  includes.js file.
